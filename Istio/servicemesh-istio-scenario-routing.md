# Prerequisites

- Use the Bash environment in Azure Cloud Shell.

[![Launch Cloud Shell in a new window](./Images/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com/)

# Create AKS cluster

Use the [az aks create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true#az-aks-create) command to create an AKS cluster. The following example creates a cluster named myAKSCluster with one node. This will take several minutes to complete.

### Azure CLI

```
az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 2 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys
```

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

> Note
>
> When creating an AKS cluster a second resource group is automatically created to store the AKS resources. For more information see Why are two resource groups created with AKS?

o configure kubectl to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, use the az aks get-credentials command. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.

#### Azure CLI

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

Note

The above command uses the default location for the Kubernetes configuration file, which is ~/.kube/config. You can specify a different location for your Kubernetes configuration file using --file.

To verify the connection to your cluster, use the kubectl get command to return a list of the cluster nodes.

#### Azure CLI

```
kubectl get nodes
```

The following example output shows the single node created in the previous steps. Make sure that the status of the node is Ready:

#### Output

```
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
aks-nodepool1-31718369-0 Ready agent 6m44s v1.12.8
```

# Install the Istio Operator on AKS

Istio provides an Operator to manage installation and updates to the Istio components within your AKS cluster. We'll install the Istio Operator using the istioctl client binary.

#### Bash

```

istioctl operator init

```

You should see something like the following output to confirm that the Istio Operator has been installed.

```Console
Using operator Deployment image: docker.io/istio/operator:1.7.3
✔ Istio operator installed
✔ Installation complete
```

The Istio Operator is installed into the istio-operator namespace. Query the namespace.

#### Bash

```
kubectl get all -n istio-operator
```

You should see the following components deployed.

```Console
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/istio-operator-6d7958b7bf-wxgdc   1/1     Running   0          2m43s

```

You can learn more about the Operator pattern and how it can help automate complex tasks via kubernetes.io.

# Install Istio components

Now that we've successfully installed the Istio Operator in our AKS cluster, it's time to install the Istio components.

We will leverage the default Istio Configuration Profile to build the Istio Operator Spec.

You can run the following istioctl command to view the configuration for the default Istio Configuration Profile.

#### Bash

```
istioctl profile dump default
```

> Note
> Istio currently must be scheduled to run on Linux nodes. If you have Windows Server nodes in your cluster, you must ensure that the Istio pods are only scheduled to run on Linux nodes. We'll use node selectors to make sure pods are scheduled to the correct nodes.

> Caution

> The Istio CNI Istio features are currently in Alpha, so thought should be given before enabling these.

Create a file called istio.aks.yaml with the following content. This file will hold the Istio Operator Spec for configuring Istio.

####Bash

```
code istio.aks.yaml
```

#### YAML

```
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
metadata:
namespace: istio-system
name: istio-control-plane
spec:

# Use the default profile as the base

# More details at: https://istio.io/docs/setup/additional-setup/config-profiles/

profile: default

# Enable the addons that we will want to use

addonComponents:
grafana:
enabled: true
prometheus:
enabled: true
tracing:
enabled: true
kiali:
enabled: true
values:
global: # Ensure that the Istio pods are only scheduled to run on Linux nodes
defaultNodeSelector:
beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux
kiali:
dashboard:
auth:
strategy: anonymous
```

Create the `istio-system` namespace and deploy the Istio Operator Spec to that namespace. The Istio Operator will be watching for the Istio Operator Spec and will use it to install and configure Istio in your AKS cluster.

#### Bash

```
kubectl create ns istio-system
```

#### Bash

```
kubectl apply -f istio.aks.yaml
```

At this point, you've deployed Istio to your AKS cluster. To ensure that we have a successful deployment of Istio, let's move on to the next section to [Validate the Istio installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/servicemesh-istio-install?pivots=client-operating-system-linux#validate-the-istio-installation).

Validate the Istio installation
Query the istio-system namespace, where the Istio and add-on components were installed by the Istio Operator:

#### Bash

```
kubectl get all -n istio-system
```

You should see the following components:

- istio\* - the Istio components
- jaeger-\*, tracing, and zipkin - tracing addon
- prometheus - metrics addon
- grafana - analytics and monitoring dashboard addon
  kiali - service mesh dashboard addon

```

You can also gain additional insight into the installation by watching the logs for the Istio Operator.

#### Bash

```
kubectl logs -n istio-operator -l name=istio-operator -f
```

If the `istio-ingressgateway` shows an external ip of <pending>, wait a few minutes until an IP address has been assigned by Azure networking.

All of the pods should show a status of Running. If your pods don't have these statuses, wait a minute or two until they do. If any pods report an issue, use the kubectl describe pod command to review their output and status.

# Accessing the add-ons

A number of add-ons were installed by the Istio Operator that provide additional functionality. The web applications for the add-ons are not exposed publicly via an external ip address.

To access the add-on user interfaces, use the istioctl dashboard command. This command uses [kubectl port-forward](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#port-forward) and a random port to create a secure connection between your client machine and the relevant pod in your AKS cluster. It will then automatically open the add-on web application in your default browser.

## Grafana

The analytics and monitoring dashboards for Istio are provided by Grafana. Remember to use the credentials you created via the Grafana secret earlier when prompted. Open the Grafana dashboard securely as follows:

```Console
istioctl dashboard grafana
```

## Prometheus

Metrics for Istio are provided by Prometheus. Open the Prometheus dashboard securely as follows:

```Console
istioctl dashboard prometheus
```

## Jaeger

Tracing within Istio is provided by Jaeger. Open the Jaeger dashboard securely as follows:

```Console
istioctl dashboard jaeger
```

## Kiali

A service mesh observability dashboard is provided by Kiali. Remember to use the credentials you created via the Kiali secret earlier when prompted. Open the Kiali dashboard securely as follows:

```Console
istioctl dashboard kiali
```

## Envoy

A simple interface to the Envoy proxies is available. It provides configuration information and metrics for an Envoy proxy running in a specified pod. Open the Envoy interface securely as follows:

```Console
istioctl dashboard envoy
<pod-name>.<namespace>
```

# Uninstall Istio from AKS

> Warning
>
> Deleting Istio from a running system may result in traffic related issues between your services. Ensure that you have made provisions for your system to still operate correctly without Istio before proceeding.

# Remove Istio

To remove Istio from your AKS cluster, delete the IstioOperator resource named istio-control-plane that we added earlier. The Istio Operator will recognize that the Istio Operator Spec has been removed, and then delete all the associated Istio components.

#### Bash

```
kubectl delete istiooperator istio-control-plane -n istio-system
```

You can run the following to check when all the Istio components have been deleted.

#### Bash

```
kubectl get all -n istio-system
```

# Remove Istio Operator

Once Istio has been successfully uninstalled, you can also remove the Istio Operator.

#### Bash

```
istioctl operator remove
```

And then finally, remove the istio- namespaces.

#### Bash

```
kubectl delete ns istio-system
kubectl delete ns istio-operator
```

## Next steps

# About this application scenario

The sample AKS voting app provides two voting options (Cats or Dogs) to users. There is a storage component that persists the number of votes for each option. Additionally, there is an analytics component that provides details around the votes cast for each option.

In this application scenario, you start by deploying version 1.0 of the voting app and version 1.0 of the analytics component. The analytics component provides simple counts for the number of votes. The voting app and analytics component interact with version 1.0 of the storage component, which is backed by Redis.

You upgrade the analytics component to version 1.1, which provides counts, and now totals and percentages.

A subset of users test version 2.0 of the app via a canary release. This new version uses a storage component that is backed by a MySQL database.

Once you're confident that version 2.0 works as expected on your subset of users, you roll out version 2.0 to all your users.

# Deploy the application

Let's start by deploying the application into your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The following diagram shows what runs by the end of this section - version 1.0 of all components with inbound requests serviced via the Istio ingress gateway:

![Diagram that shows version 1.0 of all components with inbound requests serviced via the Istio ingress gateway.](./Images/scenario-routing-components-01.png)

The artifacts you need to follow along with this article are available in the Azure-Samples/aks-voting-app GitHub repo. You can either download the artifacts or clone the repo as follows:

```Console

git clone https://github.com/Onemanwolf/Gap_Labs.git

```

Change to the following folder in the downloaded / cloned repo and run all subsequent steps from this folder:

```Console
cd Gap_Labs/code/intelligent-routing-with-istio/
```

First, create a namespace in your AKS cluster for the sample AKS voting app named voting as follows:

```Console
kubectl create namespace voting
```

Label the namespace with istio-injection=enabled. This label instructs Istio to automatically inject the istio-proxies as sidecars into all of your pods in this namespace.

```Console
kubectl label namespace voting istio-injection=enabled
```

Now let's create the components for the AKS Voting app. Create these components in the voting namespace created in a previous step.

```

> Note

> Istio has some specific requirements around pods and services. For more information, see the Istio [Requirements for Pods and Services documentation](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/prepare/requirements/).

To see the pods that have been created, use the kubectl get pods command as follows:

```Console
kubectl get pods -n voting --show-labels
```

The following example output shows there are three instances of the `voting-app` pod and a single instance of both the `voting-analytics` and voting-storage pods. Each of the pods has two containers. One of these containers is the component, and the other is the `istio-proxy`:

```Output

```

To see information about the pod, we'll use the [kubectl describe pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#describe) command with label selectors to select the voting-analytics pod. We'll filter the output to show the details of the two containers present in the pod:

#### Bash:

```Bash
kubectl describe pod -l "app=voting-analytics, version=1.0" -n voting | egrep "istio-proxy:|voting-analytics:" -A2
```

The `istio-proxy` container has automatically been injected by Istio to manage the network traffic to and from your components, as shown in the following example output:

#### Output:

```Console
  voting-analytics:
    Container ID:   docker://35efa1f31d95ca737ff2e2229ab8fe7d9f2f8a39ac11366008f31287be4cea4d

    Image:         docker.io/istio/proxyv2:1.3.2
```

You can't connect to the voting app until you create the Istio [Gateway](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/v1alpha3/gateway/) and [Virtual Service](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/v1alpha3/virtual-service/). These Istio resources route traffic from the default Istio ingress gateway to our application.

> Note
> A Gateway is a component at the edge of the service mesh that receives inbound or outbound HTTP and TCP traffic.
>
> A Virtual Service defines a set of routing rules for one or more destination services.

Use the `kubectl apply` command to deploy the Gateway and Virtual Service yaml. Remember to specify the namespace that these resources are deployed into.

```

```

```Console
kubectl apply -f istio/step-1-create-voting-app-gateway.yaml --namespace voting
```

The following example output shows the new Gateway and Virtual Service being created:

#### Output

```Output
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/voting-app created
gateway.networking.istio.io/voting-app-gateway created
```

Obtain the IP address of the Istio Ingress Gateway using the following command:

```Output
kubectl get service istio-ingressgateway --namespace istio-system -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```

The following example output shows the IP address of the Ingress Gateway:

```Output
20.188.211.19
```

Open up a browser and paste in the IP address. The sample AKS voting app is displayed.

![The AKS Voting app running in our Istio enabled AKS cluster.](./Images/scenario-routing-deploy-app-01.png)

The information at the bottom of the screen shows that the app uses version 1.0 of voting-app and version 1.0 of `voting-storage` (Redis).

## Update the application

Let's deploy a new version of the analytics component. This new version 1.1 displays totals and percentages in addition to the count for each category.

The following diagram shows what will be running at the end of this section - only version 1.1 of our voting-analytics component has traffic routed from the voting-app component. Even though version 1.0 of our voting-analytics component continues to run and is referenced by the voting-analytics service, the Istio proxies disallow traffic to and from it.

![Diagram that shows only version 1.1 of the voting-analytics component has traffic routed from the voting-app component.](./Images/scenario-routing-components-02.png)

Let's deploy version 1.1 of the voting-analytics component. Create this component in the voting namespace:

```
# voting-analytics-deployment-1.1.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: voting-analytics-1-1
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: voting-analytics
      version: "1.1"
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: voting-analytics
        version: "1.1"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: voting-analytics
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/aks/samples/voting/analytics:1.1
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          name: http
        env:
        - name: REDIS_HOST
          value: "voting-storage"



```

#### Bash

```Console
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/step-2-update-voting-analytics-to-1.1.yaml --namespace voting
```

The following example output shows the resources being created:

#### Output

```Output
deployment.apps/voting-analytics-1-1 created
```

Open the sample AKS voting app in a browser again, using the IP address of the Istio Ingress Gateway obtained in the previous step.

Your browser alternates between the two views shown below. Since you are using a Kubernetes Service for the voting-analytics component with only a single label selector (app: voting-analytics), Kubernetes uses the default behavior of round-robin between the pods that match that selector. In this case, it is both version 1.0 and 1.1 of your voting-analytics pods.

![Version 1.0 of the analytics component running in our AKS Voting app.](./Images/scenario-routing-deploy-app-01.png)

![Version 1.1 of the analytics component running in our AKS Voting app.](./Images/scenario-routing-update-app-01.png)
You can visualize the switching between the two versions of the voting-analytics component as follows. Remember to use the IP address of your own Istio Ingress Gateway.

#### Bash

```
INGRESS_IP=20.188.211.19
for i in {1..5}; do curl -si $INGRESS_IP | grep results; done
```

The following example output shows the relevant part of the returned web site as the site switches between versions:

#### Output

```
  <div id="results"> Cats: 2 | Dogs: 4 </div>
  <div id="results"> Cats: 2 | Dogs: 4 </div>
  <div id="results"> Cats: 2/6 (33%) | Dogs: 4/6 (67%) </div>
  <div id="results"> Cats: 2 | Dogs: 4 </div>
  <div id="results"> Cats: 2/6 (33%) | Dogs: 4/6 (67%) </div>
```

# Lock down traffic to version 1.1 of the application

Now let's lock down traffic to only version 1.1 of the `voting-analytics` component and to version `1.0` of the `voting-storage` component. You then define routing rules for all of the other components.

- A Virtual Service defines a set of routing rules for one or more destination services.
- A Destination Rule defines traffic policies and version specific policies.
- A Policy defines what authentication methods can be accepted on workload(s).

Use the `kubectl apply` command to replace the Virtual Service definition on your voting-app and add Destination Rules and Virtual Services for the other components. You will add a Policy to the voting namespace to ensure that all communicate between services is secured using mutual TLS and client certificates.

- The Policy has `peers.mtls.mode` set to `STRICT` to ensure that mutual TLS is enforced between your services within the `voting` namespace.

- We also set the trafficPolicy.tls.mode to ISTIO_MUTUAL in all our Destination Rules. Istio provides services with strong identities and secures communications between services using mutual TLS and client certificates that Istio transparently manages.

# Roll out a canary release of the application

Now let's deploy a new version 2.0 of the `voting-app`, `voting-analytics`, and `voting-storage` components. The new voting-storage component use MySQL instead of Redis, and the voting-app and voting-analytics components are updated to allow them to use this new voting-storage component.

The `voting-app` component now supports feature flag functionality. This feature flag allows you to test the canary release capability of Istio for a subset of users.

The following diagram shows what you will have running at the end of this section.

- Version 1.0 of the voting-app component, version 1.1 of the voting-analytics component and version 1.0 of the voting-storage component are able to communicate with each other.
- Version 2.0 of the voting-app component, version 2.0 of the voting-analytics component and version 2.0 of the voting-storage component are able to communicate with each other.
- Version 2.0 of the voting-app component are only accessible to users that have a specific feature flag set. This change is managed using a feature flag via a cookie.

![Diagram that shows what you'll have running at the end of this section.](./Images/scenario-routing-components-03.png)

First, update the Istio Destination Rules and Virtual Services to cater for these new components. These updates ensure that you don't route traffic incorrectly to the new components and users don't get unexpected access:

```Console
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/step-3-update-voting-app-with-new-storage.yaml --namespace voting
```

#### Output

deployment.apps/voting-storage-2-0 created
persistentvolumeclaim/mysql-pv-claim created
deployment.apps/voting-analytics-2-0 created
deployment.apps/voting-app-2-0 created
```

Wait until all the version 2.0 pods are running. Use the kubectl get pods command with the -w watch switch to watch for changes on all pods in the voting namespace:

```Console
kubectl get pods --namespace voting -w
```

You should now be able to switch between the version 1.0 and version 2.0 (canary) of the voting application. The feature flag toggle at the bottom of the screen sets a cookie. This cookie is used by the voting-app Virtual Service to route users to the new version 2.0.

![Version 1.0 of the AKS Voting app - feature flag IS NOT set.](./Images/scenario-routing-canary-release-01.png)

![Version 2.0 of the AKS Voting app - feature flag IS set.](./Images/scenario-routing-canary-release-02.png)

The vote counts are different between the versions of the app. This difference highlights that you are using two different storage backends.

# Finalize the rollout

Once you've successfully tested the canary release, update the voting-app Virtual Service to route all traffic to version 2.0 of the voting-app component. All users then see version 2.0 of the application, regardless of whether the feature flag is set or not:

Diagram that shows that users see version 2.0 of the application, regardless of whether the feature flag is set or not.

![Diagram that shows that users see version 2.0 of the application, regardless of whether the feature flag is set or not.](./Images/scenario-routing-components-04.png)

Update all the Destination Rules to remove the versions of the components you no longer want active. Then, update all the Virtual Services to stop referencing those versions.

Since there's no longer any traffic to any of the older versions of the components, you can now safely delete all the deployments for those components.

![The AKS Voting app components and routing.](./Images/scenario-routing-components-05.png)

You have now successfully rolled out a new version of the AKS Voting App.

## Clean up

You can remove the AKS voting app we used in this scenario from your AKS cluster by deleting the voting namespace as follows:

```Console
kubectl delete namespace voting
```

The following example output shows that all the components of the AKS voting app have been removed from your AKS cluster.

#### Output

```
namespace "voting" deleted
```
